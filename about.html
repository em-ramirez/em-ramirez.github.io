                    Hello again! I'm Emmanuel, but I commonly go by "E-man."
                </p>
                <p>
                    As said in the home page, I recently graduated from Harvard. To that end, I'm a proud first-generation
                    Latino student, navigating my way through the unknown waters of academia (and life, more broadly).
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm from California—and very proudly, too—so you'll often catch me outdoors somewhere, either at a coffee shop, soaking up the sun,
                    or running, but always, always, listening to music. I also started climbing in college so you'll catch me doing that as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anyways, as of now, I'm still discovering my interests, especially regarding my career. Hence, my current plan post-grad is to
                    just focus on bettering myself and finding my passions. I plan to pursue more side projects and try new things... as a result, 
                    this website will [hopefully] be more interesting next time you drop by!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'll leave you with some artists to check out. I claim no loyalty to any one genre of music, but these two artists stand out to me:
