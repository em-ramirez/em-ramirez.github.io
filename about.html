                    Hello again! I'm Emmanuel, but I commonly go by "E-man."
                </p>
                <p>
                    As said in the home page, I'm finishing up my Senior year at Harvard. To that end, I'm a proud first-generation
                    Latino student, navigating my way through the unknown waters of academia (and life, more broadly).
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm from California—and very proudly, too—so you'll often catch me outdoors somewhere, either at a coffee shop, soaking up the sun,
                    or running, but always, always, listening to music. I also started climbing in college so you'll catch me doing that as well (I'd say
                    I'm a solid v5-v6). I dabble with ceramics here and there and it's something I want to pursue more because let's be real, who doesn't
                    want to make their own cups and plates :p
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anyways, as of now, I don't really know what I want to do with my life post-grad. All I know is that I want to be happy with whatever
                    it is I do. So my current plan post-graduation is to just focus on bettering myself and finding my passions. I plan to start training
                    more intentionally for races as well as pursue side projects... hopefully this website will be more interesting next time you drop by!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'll leave you with some artists to check out. I claim no loyalty to any one genre of music, but these two artists do stand out to me:
