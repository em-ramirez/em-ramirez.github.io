                    I recently graduated Harvard with a B.A. in Computer Science and will be spending the foreseeable future
                    in San Francisco.

                    I'm just starting off my career, but that doesn't mean I'm without experience! Previously, I've done two internships
                    at Microsoft and one at IBM. At Harvard, I did some research, was a course assistant, and engaged in clubs. 
                    Aside from this, I enjoy being active, with my main sports being climbing and running! I also enjoy reading, coffee, 
                    and music, but you can learn more about that in my about and resume pages :)
