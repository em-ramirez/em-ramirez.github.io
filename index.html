                    I recently graduated Harvard with a B.A. in Computer Science and will be spending the foreseeable future
                    in San Francisco. I'm still exploring what I want to pursue specifically with regards to my career, but I have an 
                    interest in AI/ML (as most people do these days) as well as lower level CS topics such as computer networks and 
                    operating systems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm just starting off my career, but that doesn't mean I'm without experience! Previously, I've done two internships
                    at Microsoft and one at IBM. At Harvard, I did some research, was a course assistant, and engaged in clubs.

                    Not everything is about academia and career, however. I enjoy being active, with my main sports being
                    climbing and running! I also enjoy reading philosophy, coffee, and music, but you can learn more about that
                    in my about page :)
