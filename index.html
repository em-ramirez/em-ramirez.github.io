                        Hey, I'm Emmanuel, but I commonly go by "E-man" and I recently graduated Harvard with a B.A. in Computer Science. To that end,
                        I'm a proud first-generation Latino student, navigating my way through the unknown waters of academia (and life, more broadly).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm just starting off my career, but that doesn't mean I'm without experience! Previously, I've done two internships
                        at Microsoft and one at IBM. At Harvard, I did some research, was a course assistant, and engaged in clubs. You can read more
                        about my experience in my resume page! 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Aside from this, I will spend the foreseeable future in San Francisco and I enjoy coffee, music, and being active, with my main 
                        sports being climbing and running! My current plan post-grad is to just focus on bettering myself and finding my passions. I plan
                        to pursue more side projects and try new things... as a result, this website will [hopefully] be more interesting next time you drop by!
                    </p>

                        I'll leave you with two of my favorite artists to check out. I claim no loyalty to any one genre of music, but these two artists stand out to me:
